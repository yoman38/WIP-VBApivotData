## Employee Shift Data Processor and Excel to SQL Command Generator

### Employee Shift Data Processor

The Employee Shift Data Processor is a versatile tool designed to efficiently process and analyze employee shift data along with work statuses. Utilizing VBA (Visual Basic for Applications), this tool seamlessly integrates into an Excel VBA module. The tool's workflow is summarized as follows:

1. **User Input**: Users are prompted to provide essential details, including the target worksheet, the last row, and the column containing 'Brygada' information.

2. **Subroutines**: The tool engages two distinct subroutines, namely `PivotData` and `PivotDataUnique`, utilizing user-provided input.

3. **Empty Cell Check**: After processing, the tool meticulously inspects the created sheets for any empty cells, promptly alerting users if any are found.

### Functions

1. **GetUserInputAndRunSubroutines()**: This central function orchestrates the tool's operations. It captures user input and triggers relevant subroutines as required.

2. **PivotData(ByVal wsNum As Long, ByVal lastRow As Long, ByVal squadCol As String)**: This function generates two new sheets, "WorkersShifts" and "WorkersMonthData," and populates them with data from the specified source worksheet. Data is methodically processed row by row to populate the new sheets with pertinent information.

3. **PivotDataUnique(ByVal wsNum As Long, ByVal lastRow As Long, ByVal squadCol As String)**: Creating a new sheet named "WorkersStatus," this function fills it with unique values from the provided source worksheet. It meticulously ensures that duplicates are excluded, and the sheet exclusively holds distinct worker names and their corresponding details.

4. **CheckForEmptyCells()**: This function scrutinizes the sheets "WorkersShifts," "WorkersMonthData," and "WorkersStatus" for any lurking empty cells. Detecting any, it promptly informs users of their presence.

### How to Use the Tool

1. Click the designated button to launch the tool.
2. Respond to the ensuing dialog boxes by entering the requested inputs.
3. Witness the tool create new worksheets and expertly populate them with meticulously processed data.

**Note**: Prior to employing the tool, ensure that macros are enabled, or adjust your Excel macro security settings to facilitate their execution. Manage these settings in Excel's options under the `Trust Center Settings`.

#### v3.45
- Allow duplicates of WorkersName in WorkersStatus (if one worker is part of two brygada).
- Added, then deleted, the EmptyCellsCheck function opening: 1) a new worksheet (causing troubles with the active sheet), 2) a new workbook (too long loading), 3) a txt file (faster loading, could be usedâ€¦ but still a bit slower)

## Additional Details

Before generating an output, the following queries may arise:

- **Omitting Rows without a Specific Keyword**: This function enables row exclusion based on a designated keyword. For instance, with the following dataset:
  ```
  1 / Michael / 123
  2 / Julius / 456
  1 / Michael / 123
  1 / Olga / 789
  3 / Kevin / 789
  ```
  Selecting data range A1:C4 and filtering range A1:A5 with keyword "1" results in:
  ```
  1 / Michael / 123
  1 / Michael / 123
  1 / Olga / 789
  ```
  Choosing data range A1:C4 and filter range A1:A4 with keyword "1" results in:
  ```
  1 / Michael / 123
  1 / Michael / 123
  1 / Olga / 789
  3 / Kevin / 789
  ```
  Similarly, selecting range C1:C5 with keyword "123" yields:
  ```
  1 / Michael / 123
  1 / Michael / 123
  ```

- **Excluding Duplicate Rows Based on Specific Columns**: This feature facilitates the removal of duplicate rows based on designated columns. Using column A:
  ```
  1 / Michael / 123
  2 / Julius / 456
  ```
  And with column C:
  ```
  1 / Michael / 123
  2 / Julius / 456
  1 / Olga / 789
  ```

- **Omitting Rows with Empty Cells in a Specific Range**: This functionality discards rows containing empty cells within a specified range.

- **Inclusion of a Unique ID for Each Row**: Activation of this feature appends an ID column "[Id] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL" for each row in the table.

- **Setting Primary Key for the Table**: This choice empowers the establishment of a primary key for the table. Multiple columns can be selected and set as NOT NULL via the "ALTER TABLE ... ADD PRIMARY KEY ..." statement.

- **Adding a Foreign Key**: Selection of a column, its NOT NULL assignment, reference table, and column creation results in an "ALTER TABLE ... ADD FOREIGN KEY ... REFERENCES ..." statement.

- **Imposing NOT NULL Constraint on Other Columns**: This attribute streamlines the process of setting specific columns as NOT NULL through the "ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN ... NOT NULL" statement.

- **Inclusion of an Index**: Options include "Non-clustered," "Clustered," or "Unique Non-clustered with Sort Order." Column selection leads to the creation of 'CREATE INDEX' / 'CREATE

 CLUSTERED INDEX' / 'CREATE UNIQUE INDEX â€¦ ON â€¦ DESC' (or ASC).

- **Addition of a Constraint**: Constraints such as "unique" or "check" can be set using the "ALTER TABLE â€¦ ADD CONSTRAINT â€¦" statement.

- **Assignment of Default Value for Any Column**: Utilize this functionality to assign default values to columns via the "ALTER TABLE â€¦ ADD CONSTRAINT â€¦ DEFAULT â€¦ FOR â€¦" statement.
